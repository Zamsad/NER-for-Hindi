Goa

Anjunem Dam The Anjunem Dam is located on the Sanquelim-Belgaum highway in Chorla ghat at about 10 km from the Sanquelim town. It is one of the most idyllic places to enjoy the mystic charm and greenery around. The dam lies in a sylvan valley formed by the proximity of another peak, Morlemgad to its south-east and below one of Goa's highest peaks, Vagheri hill. For accommodation, there is a foret department rest house at Keri and an irrigation department rest house above the dam. There is also a private eco resort in Chorla ghat. The ambience at the Anjunem dam is so enchanting that visitors return to the spot every monsoon or even during other seasons. Salaulim Dam The Salaulim Dam (also spelled Selaulim, Saluli) located on the Salaulim River, a tributary of the Zuari River in Goa, India, is an integral component of the Salaulim Irrigation Project which envisages benefits of irrigation and drinking water supply. The dam is a composite earth-cum-masonry dam of 42.7 metres (140 ft) height with a water spread area of 24 km2 (9.3 sq mi). It was initially planned to provide irrigation to an ultimate potential of 14,326 hectares (35,400 acres) and water supply of 160 million litres per day (MLD) to South Goa; the water supply component for domestic and industrial use is now increased to 380 MLD. The initial cost of the project when approved in 1971 was Rs. 9.61 crore, which, as of 2007, is estimated to cost Rs 170 crores. Construction of the project was however started in 1976, the dam was completed in 2000 and the irrigation component is under final stages of completion having achieved an irrigation potential of 9,537 ha, as of 2007.
